BUILD OUTPUT DESCRIPTION
========================

To run the project from the command line, go to the dist folder and
type the following:

java -jar "JNDStudy.jar" 

Or just double click the jar file. Either way works.

Note: This was initially purely meant for the team's user study which was always done on the same laptop to control enviornment variables. Therefore, we only set it to properly scale on 1920x1080 monitors. If your monitor is a different resolution, the pictures might look slightly different.
